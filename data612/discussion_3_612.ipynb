    "It is widely understood that machines do not have emotions or cognitive thinking system - they are like functions, you have inputs and produce output based on inputs.\n",
    "Having said that, it is possible that \"output\" of machine can be too objective with no empathy. We have to think about if it will be ever possible to embed with emtion \"empathy\" in machine.\n",
    "If it is not possible, we first have to understand that machine is different from humans, which does not have any \"subjective\" decision making skill nor \"emotions\" such as love or hate.\n",
